THE MODEL
This project models a room with boxes in it (Cornell room).

RENDERERS
Phong
This renderer takes into consideration only direct light at a surface as per the 
phong reflection model. Because only point light sources are considered and there
is no checking for occulusion from the light sources, there are no shadows formed.
However, surfaces facing away from light sources are dark as per the Phong shading
model. This method is very fast compared to other renderers because there are no
recursive calls and/or reflections/occusions considered.

DIRECT ONLY
Direct-Only-Renderer considers light from emitters as well as light that hits
surfaces directly from luminaires. Because luminaires have spartial extent, objects
can have soft shadows. This rendered is relatively fast because it does not involve
any recursive calls.

BRUTEFORCE
This rendered takes into consideration indirect reflections as well as direct lighting.
A ray is traced from a pixel/eye into the scene and it bounces off multiple times before
we terminate computation. Each reflection allows for shoft shadows and for reflections
of nearby objects to appear on the surfaces of other objects. In addition, light from
emmiters bounces from objects shedding light on areas that would normally be dark. For this
rendered, i also considered adding point light sources. Because of the recursive nature of
the algorithm, rendering takes a lot of time.
